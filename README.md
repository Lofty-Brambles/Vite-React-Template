# Vite-React-Template
A React based Vite boilerplate made to suit the necessities of an opinionated, yet flexible setup. Just using this to make stuff as I learn!

The setup uses the following:
- ESLint, Prettier and Eslint-config-prettier for formatting.
- A `.scss` setup for CSS.
- React Icons library for icons.
- React-router-dom@v6 for routing.
- Vitest for tests.
- Husky and Lint-staged for pre-processing.
